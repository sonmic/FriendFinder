# FriendFinder


Friend Finder is a matchmaker application based on the user's responses to a ten question survey. 
The user responds to questions using a number rating scale 1 - Strongly Disagree to 5 - Strongly Agree. When the survey is submitted, the application will return the best match overall from the user database based on the current user's responses.

The application is implemented using a Node.js and Express server on the back end and the Bootstrap Material Design, jQuery UI
 framework on the front end.
